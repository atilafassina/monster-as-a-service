[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/08e9878b-10bb-4706-b47a-bcc84c930c6a/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/friendly-curie-b02f70/deploys)

This is a microservice wrapping requests to [D&D 5e API](https://www.dnd5eapi.co).

It will return a random monster at every request.

## Goal

This repository is an example use-case on how to use Netlify Functions with TypeScript.

| Dependencies            | Why                                           |
| ----------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Netlify DevÂ¹            | To run Netlify Functions locally              |
| Netlify Lambda          | Adds build-step to Netlify Functions          |
| TypeScript              | The compiler for TypeScript (`tsc`)           |
| node-fetch              | Brings `window.fetch` api to NodeJS           |
| babel/preset-env        | Tells Babel which JavaScript syntax to output |
| babel/preset-typescript | Teach Babel to use TypeScript compiler        |
| types/aws-lambda        | Request/Response types for AWS LambdasÂ²       |
| encoding                | depency of `node-fetch`Â³                      |

**1:** Install it globally on your system

**2:** Netlify Functions uses AWS Lambdas under the hood

**3:** It should be a dependency of `node-fetch` but itâ€™s not added in v2, so we add manually so our build doesnâ€˜t break.
